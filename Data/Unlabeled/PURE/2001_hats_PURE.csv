The HATS-GUI shall make these data sets available for viewing and/or saving as permanent files in the application. In addition to the output file, the transformation language program may specify that debugging output be written to the standard output stream. Errors encountered during program execution are written to the standard error stream. The HATS-GUI shall capture data written to these streams and make that data available to the user."
2001_hats_PURE,The HATS-GUI shall confirm that the transformation language program exists. (It is an error if the program does not exist.)
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall check that the parser file is younger than the grammar and lexical specification files and that the parser file was generated from the grammar and lexical specification files. If this is not the case, the HATS-GUI shall generate a new parser file."
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall check that a parsed version of the transformation language program exists and is younger than the parser file and the transformation language program file. If it is not, the HATS-GUI shall generate a new parsed version of the transformation language program."
2001_hats_PURE,The HATS-GUI shall start the FindTarget program using the transformation language program as input.
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall take the list of target program files generated by FindTarget, and for each file in the list it shall check that a parsed version of the target program exists and is younger than the target parser file and the target program file. If it is not, the HATS-GUI shall generate a new parsed version of the target program."
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall start the ApplyTransformation program in HATS-SML and pass the parsed transformation language program file name, the user defined library file name, and the output file name to the ApplyTransformation program. The HATS-GUI shall redirect the standard output and standard error streams and capture any text written to those streams."
