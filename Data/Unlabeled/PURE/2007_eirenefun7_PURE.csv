2007_eirenefun7_PURE,There is a requirement to regulate the membership of shunting groups to prevent uncontrolled membership. (I)
2007_eirenefun7_PURE,"The link assurance signal shall be used to provide an audible indication to all group members. For the driver, this indicates that the radio link is operational. (M)"
2007_eirenefun7_PURE,The link assurance signal shall be deactivated upon receipt of a shunting emergency call. (M)
2007_eirenefun7_PURE,"All members of the shunting group, other than the initiator of the link assurance signal, shall be unable to speak during the transmission of the link assurance signal. However, they shall be able to initiate a shunting emergency call at any time. (M)"
