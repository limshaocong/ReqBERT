2009_spica_srd_WEB,The SPICA telescope shall operate in the wavelength range 5-210µm (G1 goal: 3.5-210µm).
2009_spica_srd_WEB,The SPICA telescope shall be an aperture as large as possible which is compatible with the launch fairing.
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The total obscuration of the telescope shall be limited to <12.5% (goal G3: <10%) in terms of telescope pupil relative surface area, over the full telescope FoV (as defined in 3.3.1);"
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"If the collecting aperture of the telescope is not designed to be of a single continuous element (i.e. non-monolithic), the gaps from any segmentation shall fall within the total obscuration defined above and be contained, in term of spatial distribution, by the existing blockage (if any);"
2009_spica_srd_WEB,The amplitude transmission T of the unobstructed region(s) of the telescope pupil aperture shall be as high as possible to take benefit of the large collecting area but more specifically higher than piecewise linear transmission curve (goal G5: higher than the goal curve) represented below and defined by the following points in the “design & operation” wavelength range:
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"Within the unobscured part of the telescope pupil, the telescope transmission shall be spatially uniform within to 1.5% rms or better, over the spatial frequency range corresponding to the typical MIR coronagraph high contrast region (i.e. 3.3 to 50 cycles/D), and in the MIR spectral range 3.5-30µm."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The telescope surface cleanliness level shall be, at BOL, better than ~2000mm2/m2 or 2000ppm for particulate and 3mg/0.1m2 for molecular based on ECSS-Q-70-01A, or equivalently, (400+/-50)C in terms of MIL-STD-1246C classification."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,The SPICA telescope shall have diffraction-limited imaging capability at 5µm over a field of view of 5 arcmin radius (goal G7: 6 arcmin)
2009_spica_srd_WEB,The SPICA telescope shall keep diffraction-limited performances at 30µm over a field of view of 10 arcmin radius (goal G8: 12 arcmin)
2009_spica_srd_WEB,The mapped telescope field of view shall be unvignetted over a radius of 12 arcmin (goal G9: 15 arcmin).
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The overall maximum SPICA telescope wavefront error, over a field of view of 5 arcmin radius (goal G10: 6 arcmin), shall be 350nm rms in order to be compatible with nominal diffraction-limited performances at ?o."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The maximum telescope wavefront peak-to-valley (PTV) error, within the spatial frequency range from 0 to 50cycles/D and over the entire unobscured part of the telescope pupil shall be no higher than 2µm."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The operating temperature of the SPICA telescope shall be below 6K (goal G12: <5K), in order to limit in-field self-emission in the FIR. This specific temperature of operation means that all other telescope requirements apply under this condition (and the general space flight environment at the baseline mission orbit)."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"For every degree K above the maximum baseline telescope temperature of 6K (as per R12), the relative surface area (i.e., compared to the total telescope aperture) of this associated “higher” temperature zone shall be further reduced by at least a factor 5."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,The telescope operating temperature shall be stable to within 0.25K over a typical observation duration.
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The telescope shall provide adequate internal straylight control such as baffling to allow for SPICA observations with sky-limited sensitivity. In particular, the straylight rejection level shall be such that total background from out-of-field stray sources (artificial and natural) shall not increase the in-field optical background signal (from zodiacal light and telescope thermal self-emission) by more than 20% (goal G15: 10% TBC)."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"Any emission from observatory structure at surface temperatures >10K (respectively >50K, TBC), that enters the FIR instrument FoV (respectively the MIR instrument FoV) at telescope focal plane shall be attenuated by the telescope system and associated baffles in order to reduce the view factor to these surfaces (including their in-band emissivity and from the focal plane instrument field of view) to less than 1 part in 104 (TBC)."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"Scattered light from any natural source inside the telescope field of view (but outside the respective field of view of the focal plane instruments) shall contribute, into the respective aperture (defined by the respective FoV) of any focal plane instrument, less than 10-3 (TBC) of its peak irradiance when imaged by the telescope."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,Scattered light from any natural source outside the telescope field of view shall be attenuated to the maximum following tabulated relative levels defining the telescope PST in any azimuthal direction:
