2007_trs_mrd_web,Operation of the space segment shall be possible during all mission phases using either direct communication with Ground or via on-board intelligence and on-board data storage followed by periodic data transfer to Ground. Parameters up-linked for time- tagged deferred execution on board shall be stable for at least 17 days
2007_trs_mrd_web,"The space segment shall perform autonomously nominal operations when ground intervention is not possible. Each spacecraft shall be capable of continuing in nominal measurement mode, assuming no failure, for a period of at least 8 days"
2007_trs_mrd_web,"All spacecraft shall respond to on-board failures by switching, independent from ground control, to a redundant functional path. Where this can be accomplished without risk to satellite safety such switching shall enable the continuity of the mission timeline and performance. In the event that alternative redundant paths do not exist or that the failure effect is too complex to allow autonomous recovery, the spacecraft shall enter Survival Mode."
2007_trs_mrd_web,All spacecraft shall be able to survive in safe mode without ground intervention for a duration of at least 30 days
2007_trs_mrd_web,Recovery of S/C and P/L anomalies shall interfere as little as possible with nominal S/C operations of the other S/C (see also R-2.5.0-3 and G-2.5.1-9)
2007_trs_mrd_web,The satellite(s) shall be designed such that reconfiguration for in-flight calibration and/or orbit maintenance is minimised
