2019_bs_srd_WEB,The PS shall have the capability and interfaces to extend for future adaptations.
2019_bs_srd_WEB,Development  of  the  PS  shall  be  under  version control.
2019_bs_srd_WEB,The   system   should   be   decoupled   from   the research
2019_bs_srd_WEB,"Development of the system shall be based on the user requirements, the selected algorithms and the       developed       standardized       validation protocols."
2019_bs_srd_WEB,The  PS  development  shall  be  overseen  by  a science   team   that   drives   the   development process.
2019_bs_srd_WEB,"Each PS installation includes a set of test tools, data  and  benchmark  data  to  test  PS  integrity (end-to-end, interfaces)"
2019_bs_srd_WEB,"If   a   module   is   based   on   a   prototype,   the prototype   state   has  to   be   frozen   until  it   is implemented."
2019_bs_srd_WEB,"The verification is regarded as successful, when all tests agree within TBD limits. Hashes are to be preferred where applicable."

2019_bs_srd_WEB,The  operational  processor  shall  not  overwrite existing data. Versioning shall be used instead.
2019_bs_srd_WEB,"The  system  developed  shall  be  detailed  as  a separate  self-standing  document  providing  an overview  of  the  system  and  its  components, functionality  of the  system and its subsystems, inputs,  outputs,  resource  key  interfaces,  and resource requirements."
2019_bs_srd_WEB,Verification of the correct implementation of the prototype     system     against     the     algorithms developed is a fundamental part of the process.
2019_bs_srd_WEB,"The   verification   shall   be   documented   in   a Verification  Report.  It  shall  contain  the  chosen approach   and   the   justification,   the   selected verification data set and the verification results."
