It shall keep these inputs and refer to the information in it instead of copying it. Note: The multi-sensor matchups shall be represented by references to input files and records in them. The purpose of this is to be able to extract information from these source files in different ways, e.g. by using different sub-scene sizes or different calibration in the future. See also SST- SR-3330."
