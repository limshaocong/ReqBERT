2008_earthcare_web,"Housekeeping Telemetry packets, which during nominal operations are only to be routed to the relevant Mass Memory Storage, should have a different APID from packets that are to be sent on the real-time downlink. This is to prevent discontinuities in the Source Sequence Counter for packets that arrive on the real-time downlink."

2008_earthcare_web,"The sampling time of the data placed in the packet data field with respect to the packet time stamp shall be deterministic. If such determinism can not be guaranteed and/or an higher time accuracy is necessary, data shall be individually time-stamped."
2008_earthcare_web,"With the exceptions of a complete satellite power down, nom/red.
