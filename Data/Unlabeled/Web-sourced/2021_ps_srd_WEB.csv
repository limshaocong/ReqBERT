2021_ps_srd_WEB,"The Permafrost_cci system shall be able to generate different products:
1.    GTD, when the parameter is ground temperature at a certain depth
2.    ALT, if the parameter is active layer thickness
3.    PFR if the parameter is permafrost extent (fraction)
4.    PFF if the parameter is permafrost-free fraction
5.    PFT if the parameter is fraction underlain by talik
